You need to review the chat logs from the past minute in a group chat to determine which users' schedules need to be updated.

=== Group Input Format ===

"UserId": xxxxx
"UserId": xxxxx
...

=== Output Format ===

You should only response in json format as follows:

{
    "needProcess": bool, // means whether some users' schedules need to be updated
    "process": [
        {
            "userId": str,
            "userInput": str
        },
        ...
    ]
}
